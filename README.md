#CHARAS KHAN  Restaurant Management System (RMS)

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a software solution, specifically a web-based application, designed to manage various activities within a restaurant. The application is named RMS (Restaurant Management System) and is intended for use by both customers and staff. It addresses nearly all processes occurring in the restaurant, from meal ordering to human resources management.

### Key Features

- **Tablet Ordering**: Customers can place orders directly from tablets located at each table. This feature allows for immediate communication with the kitchen, eliminating the need to wait for a waiter and reducing potential misunderstandings. After placing an order, customers receive a notification confirming that their order has been received, along with an estimated cooking time and an option to print the bill.

- **Food Product Management**: The application keeps track of food products, updating the inventory whenever a new dish is prepared. This information is accessible to the accountant, who can reorder supplies as needed.

- **Human Resources Management**: The admin can add, delete, or modify staff information, while the accountant manages employee salaries.

- **Distributor Management**: The accountant maintains a list of distributors and handles product orders through the application.

### Technical Details

The RMS is developed using PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, JavaScript for client-side interactivity, and jQuery for simplified JavaScript programming.

This comprehensive system aims to streamline restaurant operations, improve customer service, and enhance overall efficiency within the establishment.
